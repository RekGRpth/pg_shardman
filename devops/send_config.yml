### send configs and restart nodes
# Templates in the root of the project are copied automatically. You can append
# something to them by creating same-titled in this (devops/) directory, they
# are not tracked by git.
# BTW, you can refer to ansible vars there.
# The only guc we manage dynamically by default is shardlord_connstring, it
# requires inventory knowledge
